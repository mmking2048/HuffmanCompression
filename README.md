# Huffman Compression

## Directions

The whole program is written in one file, huff.py. Run it in a console or command prompt:

>>> python huff.py

You will be prompted to enter some file names:

>>> Enter file name: 128M.txt
>>> Enter file to print encoding:
>>> Enter file to print encoded text:
>>> Enter file to print original text:

Input the file to be compressed. The rest can be left blank. The default file names are code for the frequency and huffman encoding, encoded.bin for the compressed binary file, and origfile.txt for the decompressed file.

Files will be generated for the encoding/frequency, compressed data, and decompressed data. File name will be displayed in the console.
